signal_dominance_plot(midpoint, steepness, base_size = 11,
  show_classes = TRUE)

radiation_plot(type = "a", beam_width, db_back = -30, base_size = 11)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{power of an cell}

\item{ple}{path loss exponent}

\item{range}{range}

\item{base_size}{base size of the plot}

\item{show_classes}{show the class colors}

\item{midpoint}{middle point in the logistic function to map signal strength to probability}

\item{steepness}{width of the logistic function to map signal strength to probability}

\item{type}{\code{"a"} for azimuth (horizontal) plane and \code{"e"} for elevation/vertical plane}

\item{beam_width}{beam width}

\item{db_back}{difference in signal strength between the propagation direction of the cell and the opposite direction}
}
\description{
The \code{radiation_plot} plots the radiation in the horizontal (azimuth) or vertical (elevation) plane, the \code{distance_plot} the relation between distance and signal loss, and the \code{signal_dominance} plots the relation between signal stregth and signal dominance, which is modelled as a logistic function. These plots are embedded in the interactive tool \code{\link{setup_prop_model}}.
